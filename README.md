# 🎓 Student Grade Manager (C++)

A menu-driven C++ program that manages student records, calculates averages, and performs data analysis using **dynamic memory** and **structs**.  
This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like structured data handling, loops, input validation, and array operations.

---

## 🚀 Overview
The Student Grade Manager allows users to:
- Add, update, and view student information  
- Calculate average exam scores  
- Find the **minimum**, **maximum**, and **mean** of student averages  
- Manage records dynamically (up to 25 students)  
- Display clean, formatted results using C++ I/O manipulators

## 🧩 Core Concepts Practiced
### ⚙️ Data Structures
- Custom `struct Student` with fields for ID, name, exam scores, and mean  
- Dynamic array allocation with `new` / `delete`  

### 🧮 Logic & Control Flow
- Menu-driven system using loops and conditional branching  
- Sequential search for record updates  
- Input validation to handle invalid menu options  

### 💻 C++ Fundamentals
- Console I/O with `cin`, `cout`, `getline()`  
- Output formatting using `setw`, `setprecision`, and `fixed`  
- Modular function design and consistent commenting style
